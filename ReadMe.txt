What is eCampus ?

eCampus Portal is an online test portal where each college can register themselves and make use of these services. There are three types of users: admin (or root), faculty and students. The admin will have to enter the details about the college and other required information like list of branches and subjects in each branch etc., after registration. In addition, the admin has a right to confirm the faculty registration. The second level users i.e., the faculty should first register to access these services. The registered faculty can set their customized test model and conduct online tests. The faculty can add test patterns and view the total list of patterns he created. They can upload materials for the benefit of students on various topics. The faculty can set test papers by uploading minimum number of questions needed as per their customized test pattern. The third type of users is student. Each student will be authenticated before he logs in. Once he logs in, he can edit his profile whenever he/she wants. 
The authenticated student can take tests set by their faculty on various subjects which include both academic and non-academic. The test takers can see a graphical analysis of their performance once they complete the test. Students can access the materials uploaded by the faculty, but they will not be available while taking test.
This application provides a discussion forum for the students to interact with their faculty outside the classroom. Any authenticated student can start a discussion on a topic of his interest. Other authenticated students and faculty can take part in the discussion. Student will be able to delete his replies only and discussions started by him. Incase if there is any problem, the student can contact the admin directly by filling a contact form provided in the application.
